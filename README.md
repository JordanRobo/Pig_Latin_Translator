# Pig Latin Translator

## About This Project
This Pig Latin Translator application was developed as a part of the assessment for my Certificate IV in Information Technology (Programming) offered by [Upskilled](https://www.upskilled.edu.au/). The project is designed to showcase my skills in Python programming. It reflects my ability to create functional, user-friendly software solutions as part of my programming coursework.

## Description
The Pig Latin Translator is a simple and user-friendly desktop application that converts the text in `.txt` files into Pig Latin. Pig Latin is a language game where English words are altered according to a simple set of rules. This application is built using Python and the Tkinter GUI library.

## Features
- Convert entire text files to Pig Latin with a single click.
- User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter.
- Supports basic text files (.txt format).
- Hover effects and aesthetic design for an improved user experience.

## Installation
To run the Pig Latin Translator, you will need Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Clone the repository using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JordanRobo/Pig_Latin_Translator.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd Pig_Latin_Translator
```

## Usage

After launching the application, follow these steps:
1. Click on the 'Select File' button.
2. Choose a `.txt` file that you want to convert.
3. Save the converted file to your desired location.
